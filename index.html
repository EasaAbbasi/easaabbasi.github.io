            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home">Max Planck Institute for Informatics</a> and a member
                of the <a href="https://sensint.mpi-inf.mpg.de/">Sensorimotor Interaction Group</a>. I received my Ph.D. degree from Koc University in
                January 2024. During my Ph.D. studies at the <a href="https://rml.ku.edu.tr/">Robotics and Mechatronics Laboratory (RML)</a>, I worked
                on characterizing electroadhesive tactile displays and understanding the human sense of touch. My current research interests include
                haptics, human-computer interaction (HCI), and the intersection of haptics and AI. In my research, I aim to develop methods and tools
                for understanding human sense of touch, developing AI models to enhance haptics, and developing tactile displays to convey sensory information.

                    <h3>Scene2Hap: Combining LLMs and Physical Modeling for Automatically Generating Vibrotactile Signals for Full VR Scenes</h3>
                    <p>We present Scene2Hap, an LLM-centered system that automatically designs object-level vibrotactile feedback for entire VR scenes based on the objects' semantic attributes and physical context. Scene2Hap employs a multimodal large language model to estimate the semantics and physical context of each object, including
                        its material properties and vibration behavior, from the multimodal information present in the VR scene. This semantic and physical context is then used to create plausible vibrotactile signals by generating or retrieving audio signals and converting them to vibrotactile signals. For the more realistic spatial
                        rendering of haptics in VR, Scene2Hap estimates the propagation and attenuation of vibration signals from their source across objects in the scene, considering the estimated material properties and physical context, such as the distance and contact between virtual objects. Results from two user studies confirm that
                        Scene2Hap successfully estimates the semantics and physical context of VR scenes, and the physical modeling of vibration propagation improves usability, perceived materiality, and spatial awareness.</p>

                    <h3>Physical Compliance and the Compliance Illusion: The Importance of Action for Perception</h3>
                    <p>We present a detailed analysis of compliance estimates and pressure profiles of exploration behaviors of 12 participants while perceiving both physical and virtual compliance. Our results indicate that the experience of virtual compliance provided by the compliance illusion is distinct from that of physical compliance
                        and that these experiences are mediated by distinct sensorimotor processes. This is evident in the non-additive nature of both real and illusory compliance perceptions and the separable exploratory actions of the participants in response to real and illusory compliance. These insights affect the design of augmented
                        and virtual tactile reality systems, shed light on the mechanisms of compliance illusion, and provide data in support of closed-loop theories of tactile perception.</p>

                    <h3>Effect of Finger Orientation on Contact Stiffness and Area During Sliding</h3>
                    <p>We conducted an experimental study to investigate the evolution of apparent contact area between a human fingerpad and a smooth flat surface under normal loading (stationary finger) and combined loading (sliding finger) conditions for 4 different internal rotations of the index finger (away from the second finger)
                        about its axial (longitudinal) axis and 2 different sliding directions. Our results show a reduction in the contact area for radial sliding as expected, but a surprising increase in the ulnar direction for the higher finger rotations. We argue that this asymmetric behavior in contact area evolution stems from the
                        changes in the equivalent radius of curvature and stiffening of the finger as the rotation angle increases, which manifests itself as the asymmetric stress distribution at the leading and trailing edges of the fingerpad in our finite element simulations.</p>

                    <h3>Experimental Estimation of Gap Thickness and Electrostatic Forces Between Contacting Objects Under Electroadhesion.</h3>
                    <p>We proposed a new and systematic approach based on electrical impedance measurements to infer the electrostatic forces between two dielectric materials under electroadhesion (EA). The proposed approach is applied to tactile displays, where skin and voltage-induced touchscreen impedances are measured and
                        subtracted from the total impedance to obtain the remaining impedance to estimate the electrostatic forces between the finger and the touchscreen. This approach also marks the first instance of experimental estimation of the average air gap thickness between a human finger and a voltage-induced
                        capacitive touchscreen. Moreover, the effect of electrode polarization impedance on EA is investigated. Precise measurements of electrical impedances confirm that electrode polarization impedance exists in parallel with the impedance of the air gap, particularly at low frequencies, giving rise to
                        the commonly observed charge leakage phenomenon in EA.</p>

                    <h3>Electronic Skin (E-Skin)</h3>
                    <p>Inspired by the sensory properties of skin, we presented a micro-fabricated, multiplexed electronic skin (e-skin) with actuators for sensory feedback in upper limb amputation. The piezoelectric-capacitive sensor array detects static pressure, temperature, vibration, and texture, with
                        integrated actuators stimulating the skin to provide real-time feedback. The sensors integrate with actuators via readout electronics, making the system standalone and easy to use. The flexible, compact sensor array design (two pixels within a 1 cm² footprint) detects a wide range of
                        pressure (0.5–10 kPa), temperature (22–60 °C), vibration (35–100 Hz), and texture (2.5–45 Hz), suitable for daily use. The e-skin, attached to a prosthetic finger, is tested for feasibility on human volunteers with wrist-mounted actuators.</p>

                    <p>We investigated the effect of finger moisture on the tactile perception of electroadhesion with 10 participants. Participants with moist fingers exhibited markedly higher threshold levels. Our electrical impedance measurements showed a substantial reduction in impedance magnitude
                        when sweat was present at the finger-touchscreen interface, indicating increased conductivity. Supporting this, our mechanical friction measurements showed that the relative increase in electrostatic force due to electroadhesion is lower for a moist finger.</p>

                    <p>We investigated the effect of electrode polarization (EP) impedance on electroadhesion (EA) between a human finger and a voltage-induced touchscreen. By conducting precise measurements of electrical impedances, we could ascertain the presence of EP impedance that operates in
                        parallel with the impedance of the air gap between finger and touchscreen. Our findings indicate that the EP impedance plays a dominant role, particularly at low frequencies, thereby giving rise to the charge leakage phenomenon commonly observed in EA.</p>

                    <p>In this study, we first perform 2AFC experiments with 8 participants to quantify their tactile discrimination ability of 5 smooth glass surfaces coated with 3 different materials. We then measure the coefficient of friction between human finger and those 5 surfaces via a
                        custom-made tribometer and their surface energies via Sessile drop test performed with 4 different liquids. The results of our psychophysical experiments and the physical measurements show that coating material has a strong influence on our tactile perception and human
                        finger is capable of detecting differences in surface chemistry due to, possibly, molecular interactions.</p>

                    <h3>Frequency-Dependent Electroadhesion</h3>
                    <p>In this project, we investigated the frequency-dependent behavior of electrostatic forces between a human finger and a voltage-induced touchscreen. The experimental data (collected using our custom-made tribometer) showed that electrostatic force follows an inverted parabolic
                        curve with a peak value around 250 Hz. Following the experimental characterization of electrostatic forces, an electro-mechanical model based on the fundamental laws of electric fields and Persson's multi-scale contact mechanics theory was developed. Compared to the existing
                        ones in the literature, the proposed model takes into account the charge accumulation and transfer at the interfaces of finger and touch screen. The model is in good agreement with the experimental data and shows that the change in magnitude of electrostatic force is mainly
                        due to the leakage of charge from the Stratum Corneum to the touch screen at frequencies lower than 250 Hz and electrical properties of the SC at frequencies higher than 250 Hz.</p>
